        "The Bhagwati Temple has a rich history dating back to the 14th century when it was established by local rulers as a center of worship for Goddess Bhagwati. During the Portuguese colonial period, many Hindu temples were destroyed, but this temple survived due to its remote location and the devotion of local communities who protected it. The temple underwent several renovations over the centuries, with the most significant restoration taking place in the 18th century when the current structure was largely completed.
